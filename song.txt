Rolling down the freeway
Master to the speed of light
Screaming up in the air
Bursting through the night
No rest, I've stayed here too long
It's time to move on
Reality's a three way
A scenery defined
By tomorrow dubbed a mystery
And the past just blurry lines
If there's ever been injustice in my name
I bow unto blame
And you can give me everything I need this way
We'll be loving till the first light of the day
